hello i'm yahya saadaoui this readme file asked for :


step 1 :
I head over to the home page and then i chose settings then  I scrolled down to the bottom of the page , I clicked on api accounts and then I created a new api with the following information
Token type : Stencil CLI token
Name : YAHYA SAADAOUI 2023
then I started installing the stencil cli from the documentation.



step 2 :
I have searched how to use the stencil cli then I learned about the color swatch and I added some code to
" templates\pages\category.html " .

styling the color swatch took me less than expected given that I had issues with logging into BigCommerce store account.
